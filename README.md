color me
==========

This is my experimental chrome extension  which change background color of the active tab page.
There is a popup of eye catching  background color list, you can add as many. It works with core javascript.


This will clear my concepts on

 - How to send message from `popup` to `content_script`
 - use of `JSON.stringify` while sending variable
 - How to use variables through `code:` argument not just single line of execution
